# Making your exploratory data analysis purrr

An R script containing all code used in my satRday presentation (17 March 2018, Cape Town, South Africa) on the use of the `map` and `walk` functions from the `purrr` package to iterate over data in a nested dataframe to produce exploratory plots. The script, unlike the presentation, includes code to generate html tables of tabulated summary data. 

The slides can be found on [_Speakers Deck_](https://speakerdeck.com/kamermanpr/making-exploratory-data-analysis-purrr#), and the data used in the examples can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/kamermanpr/carrots.git).
